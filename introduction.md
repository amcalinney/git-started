# Introduction to Git Started
## Version Control 
### What is version control?
Version control is a component in software configuration management that allows us to manage the changes that are made to a project over time.
New changes to files can be saved while also retaining the changes made in all of the previous versions.

### Benefits of using a version control system
* **Collaboration and synchronisation**
* **Backup and restore**
* **Track changes**
* **Track ownership**

### Type of version control 
* **Centralized version control**: A single '*central*' copy of your project exists on a server. Changes are committed to this central repository. 
* **Distributed version control**: The complete codebase is on a server. Each person working on the codebase clones a complete copy, including the full history.
* [More info on the types of version control here](https://medium.com/faun/centralized-vs-distributed-version-control-systems-a135091299f0)


### Version control tools
* [CVS - Concurrent Versions Systems](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/): 
* [SVN - Apache Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)
* [Comparisons of version control software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version-control_software)

## Version control hosting software
There are lots of solutions for hosting code repositories. They allow the people to collaborate on source code and manage a remote repository to which code changes can be committed to and pulled down to local machines. 

### Version control hosting solutions
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)
* [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

* [Comparisons of source code hosting facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source-code-hosting_facilities)
* [50 Source code repository hosts](https://stackify.com/source-code-repository-hosts/)

### We will be using GitHub in this workshop
