# Introduction to Git Started
Welcome to Git Started, a workshop by Coffee&Code.

Coffee&Code is a volunteer lead group. We have been hosting beginner friendly code events from January 2019.

Today we will be learning about version control and source code repositories.

You can find us on twitter here: [@BelfastCode](https://twitter.com/belfastcode)
You can join us on Meetup here: [Coffee&Code Belfast](https://www.meetup.com/coffee-code-belfast/)

## Version Control 
### What is version control?
Version control is a component in software configuration management that allows us to manage the changes that are made to a project over time.
New changes to files can be saved while also retaining the changes made in all of the previous versions.

### Benefits of using a version control system
* **Collaboration and synchronisation**
* **Backup and restore**
* **Track changes**
* **Track ownership**

### Type of version control 
* **Centralized version control**: A single '*central*' copy of your project exists on a server. Changes are committed to this central repository. 
* **Distributed version control**: The complete codebase is on a server. Each person working on the codebase clones a complete copy, including the full history.
* [More info on the types of version control here](https://medium.com/faun/centralized-vs-distributed-version-control-systems-a135091299f0)


### Version control tools
* [CVS - Concurrent Versions Systems](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/): 
* [SVN - Apache Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)

## Version control hosting software
There are lots of solutions for hosting code repositories. They allow the people to collaborate on source code and manage a remote repository to which code changes can be committed to and pulled down to local machines. 

### Version control hosting solutions
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)
* [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

* [Comparisons of source code hosting facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source-code-hosting_facilities)
* [50 Source code repository hosts](https://stackify.com/source-code-repository-hosts/)
